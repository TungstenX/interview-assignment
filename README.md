# Interview Assignment 
Proof of skills

# Introduction
This is a simple java microservice to demonstrate my skills as a developer

The specific technologies involved are:
- Git (ver 2.7.4.)
- Apache Maven (ver 3.9.9. - not the sucky one shipped with Netbeans &#245;.&#212;)
- Passion with a sprinkling of unicorn horn

# Development
I use Netbeans 8.2 on Ubuntu 18.04.

## Assumptions
- Shallow tests just for demonstration

## Time allocation
The following is my time allocated to this project:
- 11.5 hours: Coding the solution
- 3.5 hours: Containerize solution
- 30 minutes: Packaging and prettying up everything

# Usage

`java -jar interview-assignment-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Containerized
